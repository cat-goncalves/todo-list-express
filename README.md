## Optimizations


## Lessons Learned:
To create this project, I revisited a previous project and updated it to be a full-stack CRUD app. I enjoyed creating the original to-do list project and was very excited to improve upon it. It was helpful to look back at my previous code and creating this project gave me a chance to revisit my own work and make improvements based on the additional concepts I have learned.
